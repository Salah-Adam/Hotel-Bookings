# Hotel-Bookings: Unpacking Hotel Cancellation Trends
SQL Based Project

## Project Objetives
  - The main purpose of creating the project was to practice my SQL skill.
  - As a data-driven professional in the hospitality industry, understanding booking cancellations is crucial for optimizing revenue and operational efficiency. Recently, I dug into a        hotel booking data to uncover key trends and provide actionable insights. Here's what I found:

## Dataset Used
   - <a href="">Dataset</a>
## Tools & Skills:

  - This analysis was conducted using SQL to query and analyze our extensive hotel booking database. The ability to extract, manipulate, and interpret data is essential for driving 
    informed decisions in today's competitive landscape.

    
## The analysis focused on two key areas:

  - Monthly Cancellation Rates by Hotel Type: Identifying specific periods or hotel types with higher cancellation rates.
  - Impact of Lead Time and Deposit Type on Cancellations: Examining the relationship between booking lead time, deposit policies, and cancellation likelihood.

# Key Insights:
  
- Monthly Cancellation Trends: My analysis revealed a higher cancellation rates for City Hotels compared to the other hotel, Resort hotels. Also, City Hotels has lower cancellation rete 
  in Summer and Resort hotels have the lowest cancellation rates in months August and November. This suggests potential seasonal factors or specific events influencing booking decisions.
  
-  Lead Time and Deposit Impact: I found that bookings with longer lead times tend to have higher cancellation rates across all deposit types. 
  For bookings with 'No deposit' policy, the average lead time for canceled bookings  is significantly higher than for non-canceled bookings which indicates when guests don't have a 
  financial commitment upfront, they are more likely to cancel bookings.

## Recommendations:

  - Based on these insights, it is important to Explore strategies to reduce cancellations for long lead time bookings and for 'no deposit' policy, such as proactive guest communication or early confirmation requests.
